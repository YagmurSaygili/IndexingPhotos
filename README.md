# IndexingPhotos
An intermediate approach on C program that creates an index of a given list of photos

In this assignment, I was given a list of photos in an external text file called “photos.txt”.

This file includes the following information -->
  
  Name: name of the photo
  Dimension: dimension of the photo
  Size: size of the photo
  City: name of the city that the photo has been taken
  Country: name of the country that the photo has been taken
  Year: year that the photo has been taken
  
My task here was process the file (photos.txt) and generate an AVL tree based on the country. If there is more than one photo with the same country, they should then be stored together in the same node.

The program should be executed from the command line by giving
photos.txt like file given as a parameter

Example --> C:\Desktop > indexingphotos.exe photos.txt

Used objectives: AVLTree, intermediate Data Structure operations, AVLTree search, string operations, Single and Double rotation with AVL tree, self created libraries to improve readability.

Function explanations are given in the code files.
